The recording, captured by R. Gordon and Valentina Wasson, represents one of the earliest documented instances of an **indigenous entheogenic ritual** introduced to the West.\n\nThese chants are not merely songs but **prayers, incantations, and spiritual technologies** designed to guide participants through profound healing, divination, and communion with divine forces through the sacred mushroom (*Psilocybe mexicana*).\n\n---\n\n## 🎵 Style & Structure\n\n- Repetitive vocalizations such as **\"no, no, no...\"** and **\"oh, oh, oh...\"**\n- Mazatec language phrases interspersed with invocations\n- Often includes personal or spiritual affirmations delivered in trance\n- Vocables used to induce altered states and open communication with the spirit world\n\n---\n\n## 🎧 Listen\n\n- **Spotify**: [Soso Soso – María Sabina](https://open.spotify.com/track/5b9lvEoJc6JuSbPsdRTAH9)\n- **Bandcamp**: [Mushroom Ceremony of the Mazatec Indians](https://deathisnot.bandcamp.com/album/mushroom-ceremony-of-the-mazatec-indians-of-mexico)\n- **Smithsonian Folkways**: [Album Page](https://folkways.si.edu/maria-sabina/mushroom-ceremony-of-the-mazatec-indians-of-mexico/american-indian-sacred/music/album/smithsonian)\n\n---\n\n## 🧘‍♀️ Ceremonial Role\n\n- **Purpose**: Healing, divination, spiritual visioning\n- **Medium**: Sacred mushrooms + prayer chants\n- **Function**: Induce trance, invite healing spirits, navigate spiritual dimensions\n\n---\n\n## 🕊️ Legacy\n\nMaría Sabina’s voice remains one of the most iconic in the global psychedelic and indigenous healing movements. Her chants, preserved through recordings, continue to inspire **spiritual seekers, ethnobotanists, and ceremonial musicians** worldwide.\n"
