  "content": "# Chongka Santo – A Chant of María Sabina (Mazatec Velada)\n\n**“Chongka Santo”** is a contemporary phonetic transcription of a sacred chant performed by **María Sabina**, the renowned Mazatec *curandera* (healer) from Huautla de Jiménez, Oaxaca, Mexico. This chant originates from Sabina's **mushroom veladas** — nighttime healing ceremonies that invoked spiritual guidance through the use of psilocybin mushrooms (*niños santos*). The phrases in this chant, including _“Chongka Kilianya Do”_, _“Chongka Kui Shrinya Do”_, and the repeated _“Chonga Santo, na-to”_, are authentic renderings of her ceremonial language.\n\n---\n\n## 📜 Source & Authenticity\n\nThese lines closely match known **field recordings** and **transcriptions** from Sabina’s historic ceremony recorded in 1956 by R. Gordon Wasson. That session, later released as _“Mushroom Ceremony of the Mazatec Indians of Mexico”_ by Folkways Records, captures Sabina’s original chants in Mazatec and Spanish.\n\nIn both the recordings and published transcripts (notably *María Sabina: Her Life and Chants* by Álvaro Estrada), we find exact or near-exact matches to the phrases transcribed in this version:\n\n- **“Chongka Kilianya Do”** aligns with Sabina's phrase _“I am a woman fallen into the world”_  \n- **“Chongka Kui Shrinya Do”** corresponds to _“I am a woman who gives life”_  \n- **“Chongka Kune Nya Do”** matches _“I am a woman who reanimates”_\n\nThese lines are part of a poetic and powerful **assertion of identity** — a common structure in Sabina’s chants where she calls upon her spiritual lineage and power as a healer.\n\n---\n\n## ✝ Syncretism and “Chonga Santo”\n\nThe repeated invocations of _“Chonga Santo, na-to”_ reflect Sabina’s deep **syncretism**, blending indigenous Mazatec cosmology with Christian iconography. In her veladas, Sabina regularly invoked saints, angels, and the Virgin Mary, often referring to _“Santo Padre,” “Santa Madre,”_ and _“todos los santos”_ (all the saints).\n\nThe “Chonga Santo” lines likely derive from this segment of her chants where she calls upon:\n\n> “You, holy Father…  \n> You, my Mother Shepherdess…  \n> All the saints… all the virgins… who are in the house of heaven…”\n\nAs recorded in the 1956 ceremony, this invocation of _“santo”_ and _“santa”_ is repeated rhythmically to build spiritual focus and call forth protective energies.\n\n---\n\n## 🎧 Where to Hear It\n\n- **Recordings**:  \n  _Mushroom Ceremony of the Mazatec Indians of Mexico_ (1956) – [Smithsonian Folkways](https://folkways.si.edu)  \n- **Transcripts & Translation**:  \n  *María Sabina: Her Life and Chants* by Álvaro Estrada  \n- **Ethnographic Context**:  \n  Works by R. Gordon Wasson, E.V. Pike, and Henry Munn document this chant’s structure, language, and symbolism.\n\n---\n\n## 🌀 Structure & Performance\n\nSabina’s chants are often structured in two parts:\n\n1. **Self-declaration** — poetic proclamations of the healer’s role:  \n   - “I am a woman born…”  \n   - “I am a woman of thought…”  \n   - “I am a woman who reanimates…”\n\n2. **Invocation** — rhythmic appeals to saints, ancestors, and spiritual beings:  \n   - “Santo… santo… santo…”  \n   - “Padre… Madre… Cristo…”  \n   - “Who are in the house of heaven…”\n\nThe chant alternates between these forms in trance-inducing cycles. Repetition is central — the intention is to **weave the spiritual world into the ceremony through rhythm and word**.\n\n---\n\n## 🗣️ Summary\n\n**“Chongka Santo”** is a faithful phonetic echo of **María Sabina’s velada chants**, drawing directly from the 1956 ceremony and her poetic invocations of sacred identity and divine intercession. The blending of *Mazatec grammar*, *Catholic reference*, and *mushroom-fueled spiritual vision* make this one of the most iconic styles of ceremonial chanting in 20th-century indigenous Mesoamerica.\n\nThis chant is not only musically mesmerizing but also **philosophically rich** — an affirmation of life, healing, ancestry, and holiness.\n\n---\n\n> _“Soy mujer nacida.  \n> Soy mujer caída al mundo.  \n> Soy mujer de pensamiento.  \n> Soy mujer que da vida.  \n> Soy mujer que reanima.”_  \n> — María Sabina, 1956\n\n"
