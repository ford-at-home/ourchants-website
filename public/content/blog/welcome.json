  "summary": "An introduction to OurChants and our mission to preserve sacred chants.",
  "published": true,
  "content": "\nI'm Ford Prior, a software engineer and dad of three. After an ayahuasca ceremony in Costa Rica, I became obsessed with remembering the real songs I heard: icaros, sung in-person by shamans, raw and powerful.\n\nI hunted them down and found a broken site called [OurChants.org](https://ourchants.org). The site was full of field recordings—unpolished, intimate, sacred—but riddled with errors. I tracked down the original files, rebuilt the site with a Spotify-style interface on AWS, and brought 200 chants back online in a searchable format.\n\nIf that resonates, I'd love your input to guide feature development:\n👉 Take this [5 question survey](/survey.html)\n\nYour voice helps shape what comes next."
