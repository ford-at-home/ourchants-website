    summary: "An introduction to OurChants and our mission to preserve sacred chants.",
    content: `I'm Ford Priorâ€”a software engineer and dad of three. After an ayahuasca ceremony in Costa Rica, I became obsessed with remembering the real songs I heard: icaros, sung by shamans, raw and powerful. Not Spotify loops; the real deal.

I hunted them down and found a broken site called OurChants.org. The site was full of field recordingsâ€”unpolished, intimate, sacredâ€”but riddled with errors. I tracked down the original files, rebuilt the site with a Spotify-style interface on AWS, and brought 200 chants back online in a searchable format.

If that resonates, I'd love your input to guide feature development:
