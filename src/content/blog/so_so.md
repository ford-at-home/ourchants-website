## ✨ Overview

"Soso Soso" is a sacred chant performed by the legendary Mazatec curandera **María Sabina** during a traditional **velada**—a mushroom healing ceremony. The recording, captured by R. Gordon and Valentina Wasson, represents one of the earliest documented instances of an **indigenous entheogenic ritual** introduced to the West.

These chants are not merely songs but **prayers, incantations, and spiritual technologies** designed to guide participants through profound healing, divination, and communion with divine forces through the sacred mushroom (*Psilocybe mexicana*).
