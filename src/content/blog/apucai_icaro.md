# Apucai Anti Runa – Invocation Icaro (Quechua)

**“Apucai Anti Runa”** is a traditional *Quechua-language icaro* used in ayahuasca ceremonies to invoke protective ancestral energies. It calls in both masculine and feminine spirits, grounding the space in love and strength. Though not originally from the Shipibo-Conibo tradition, it is widely sung in Amazonian medicine ceremonies across cultures.

This icaro is often sung with a steady, chant-like rhythm and is easy to follow and repeat. It’s been preserved and shared by ceremonial groups such as the **Arizona Yagé Assembly**, who provide both lyrics and recordings.

Apucai anti runa  
Yaya nihuan churacamu  
Apucai anti runa  
Yaya nihuan churacamu

Ancha munay pica huarmi
