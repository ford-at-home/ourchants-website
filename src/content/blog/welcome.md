I'm Ford Prior, a software engineer and dad of three. After an ayahuasca ceremony in Costa Rica, I became obsessed with remembering the real songs I heard: icaros, sung in-person by shamans, raw and powerful.

I hunted them down and found a broken site called [OurChants.org](https://ourchants.org). The site was full of field recordingsâ€”unpolished, intimate, sacredâ€”but riddled with errors. I tracked down the original files, rebuilt the site with a Spotify-style interface on AWS, and brought 200 chants back online in a searchable format.

If that resonates, I'd love your input to guide feature development:
