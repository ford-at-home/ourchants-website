## Lyrics

```
I can feel it in my body,
I can feel it in my soul.
I can feel it in my body,
I can feel it in my soul.
I can feel it in my body,
I can feel it in my soul.

It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.

I can feel it in my body,
I can feel it in my soul.
It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.

I can feel it in my soul,
It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.
I can feel it in my soul,
It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.

I can feel it in my body,
I can feel it in my soul.
It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.

I can feel it in my body,
I can feel it in my soul.
I can feel it in my body,
I can feel it in my soul.

It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.
I can feel it in my soul,
It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.
I can feel it in my soul,
It's the reason it comes down to meâ€”
It's my fire.
I can feel it in my soul.
```
